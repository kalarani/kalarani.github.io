Hi there, My name is Kalarani. I live in Chennai, TamilNadu.

My background is in electronics and communication. However, I’ve spent all of my career, building softwares. I’m currently with [Sahaj](https://sahaj.ai/) as a Solution Consultant. Started my career at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) and had the opportunity to work across a different variety of tech stack and business domains - that made me a polyglot programmer and a generalist.

On the personal front, I'm married and a mother of two kids - very tough stakeholders who constantly put my consulting skills to test :)

When I'm not honing my influencing and persuading skills with my kids, I find myself reading books, doing pencil sketches, long stitching or practicing keyboard.
